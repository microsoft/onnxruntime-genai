/*
 * General purpose logging for GenAI
 *
 * The two functions to access the log are at the top, SetLogBool and SetLogString.
 * These functions modify the variables in the global LogItems structure.
 *
 * For example, to enable logging, just SetLogBool("enabled", true)
 * To dump model run call input tensors, SetLogBool("model_input_values", true)
 *
 * NOTE: The names in LogItems must match the strings in the APIs and the strings displayed for log entries.
 *       This makes it easy to know what option is displaying which data, and to easily know how to turn options off.
 *
 * Logging to a file is special: SetLogString("filename", "path") as "filename" is not a string in LogItems
 *
 * COLOR: The functions use ANSI SGR terminal codes for color, the 'struct SGR' below makes it easy to add common
 *        options during log options. Just look in the code for examples of how to use it. Note that the colors
 *        may differ in intensity/saturation on different platforms.
 *
 *        "warning" messages will appear in yellow, there is a special case in the Log(...) function for this
 *        There is no red for errors, as errors are exceptions.
