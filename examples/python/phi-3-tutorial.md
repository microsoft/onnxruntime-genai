# Run the Phi-3 Mini models with the ONNX Runtime generate() API

## Steps
1. [Download Phi-3 Mini](#download-the-model)
2. [Install the generate() API](#install-the-generate()-api-package)
3. [Run Phi-3 Mini](#run-the-model)

## Download the model 

Download either or both of the [short](https://aka.ms/phi3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx) and [long](https://aka.ms/phi3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx) context Phi-3 mini models from Hugging Face.


For the short context model.

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx
```

For the long context model

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx
```

These model repositories have models that run with DirectML, CPU and CUDA.

## Install the generate() API package

**Unsure about which installation instructions to follow?** Here's a bit more guidance:

Are you on Windows machine with GPU?
* I don't know &rarr; Review [this guide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learning-center/how-to-check-gpu) to see whether you have a GPU in your Windows machine.
* Yes &rarr; Follow the instructions for [DirectML](#directml).
* No &rarr; Do you have an NVIDIA GPU?
  * I don't know &rarr; Review [this guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#verify-you-have-a-cuda-capable-gpu) to see whether you have a CUDA-capable GPU.
  * Yes &rarr; Follow the instructions for [NVIDIA CUDA GPU](#nvidia-cuda-gpu).
  * No &rarr; Follow the instructions for [CPU](#cpu).
 
*Note: Only one package is required based on your hardware.*

### DirectML


```
pip install numpy
pip install --pre onnxruntime-genai-directml
```

### NVIDIA CUDA GPU


```
pip install numpy
pip install --pre onnxruntime-genai-cuda --index-url=https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/onnxruntime-genai/pypi/simple/
```

### CPU


```
pip install numpy
pip install --pre onnxruntime-genai
```

## Run the model

Run the model with [phi3-qa.py](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/blob/main/examples/python/phi3-qa.py).

The script accepts a model folder and takes the generation parameters from the config in that model folder. You can also override the parameters on the command line.

This example is using the long context model running with DirectML on Windows.

The `-m` argument is the path to the model you downloaded from HuggingFace above.
The `-l` argument is the length of output you would like to generate with the model.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/main/examples/python/phi3-qa.py -o phi3-qa.py
python phi3-qa.py -m Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx/directml/directml-int4-awq-block-128 -l 2048
```

Once the script has loaded the model, it will ask you for input in a loop, streaming the output as it is produced the model. For example:

```bash
Input: Tell me a joke about creative writing
 
Output:  Why don't writers ever get lost? Because they always follow the plot! 
```
