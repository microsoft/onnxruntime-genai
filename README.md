# ONNX Runtime Generative AI

Run generative AI models with ONNX Runtime.

This library provides the generative AI loop for ONNX models, including inference with ONNX Runtime, logits processing, search and sampling, and KV cache management.

Users can call a high level `generate()` method, or run each iteration of the model in a loop.

* Support greedy/beam search and TopP, TopK sampling to generate token sequences
* Built in logits processing like repetition penalties
* Easy custom scoring

See full documentation at [https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/genai].

## Features

* Supported model architectures:
  * Gemma
  * LLaMA
  * Mistral
  * Phi-2
* Supported targets:   
  * CPU
  * GPU (CUDA)
* Supported sampling features

## Roadmap

* Stable diffusion pipeline
* Automatic model download and cache
* More model architectures

## Sample code for phi-2 in Python

[Install](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/genai/howto/install) the onnxruntime-genai Python package.

```python
import onnxruntime_genai as og

model = og.Model(f'models/microsoft/phi-2')

tokenizer = og.Tokenizer(model)

prompt = '''def print_prime(n):
    """
    Print all primes between 1 and n
    """'''

tokens = tokenizer.encode(prompt)

params = og.SearchParams(model)
params.set_search_options({"max_length":200})
params.input_ids = tokens

output_tokens = model.generate(params)

text = tokenizer.decode(output_tokens)

print("Output:")
print(text)
```

## Model download and export

ONNX models are run from a local folder, via a string supplied to the `Model()` method. 

You can bring your own ONNX model or use the model builder utility, included in this package. 

Install model builder dependencies.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install transformers
pip install torch
pip install onnx
pip install onnxruntime
```

Export int4 CPU version 
```bash
huggingface-cli login --token <your HuggingFace token>
python -m onnxruntime_genai.models.builder -m microsoft/phi-2 -p int4 -e cpu -o <model folder>
```

## Known issues

* Mistral and Gemma support on CUDA only
