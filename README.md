# ONNX Runtime Generative AI

Run generative AI models with ONNX Runtime.

This library provides the generative AI loop for ONNX models, including inference with ONNX Runtime, logits processing, search and sampling, and KV cache management.

Users can call a high level `generate()` method, or run each iteration of the model in a loop.

* Search techniques like greedy/beam search to generate token sequences
* Built in scoring tools like repetition penalties
* Easy custom scoring

## Sample code for phi-2 in Python

Install onnxruntime-genai.

(Temporary) Build and install from source according to the instructions below.


```python
import onnxruntime_genai as og

model=og.Model(f'models/microsoft/phi-2', device_type)

tokenizer = model.create_tokenizer()

prompt = '''def print_prime(n):
    """
    Print all primes between 1 and n
    """'''

tokens = tokenizer.encode(prompt)

params=og.SearchParams(model)
params.max_length = 200
params.input_ids = tokens

output_tokens=model.generate(params)

text = tokenizer.decode(output_tokens)

print("Output:")
print(text)
```


## Features

* Supported model architectures:
  * Phi-2
  * Llama
  * GPT
* Supported targets:   
  * CPU
  * GPU (CUDA)
* Supported sampling features
  * Beam search
  * Greedy search

## Build from source

This step requires `cmake` to be installed.

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai
   ```

2. Install ONNX Runtime

These instructions are for the Linux GPU build of ONNX Runtime. Replace the location with the operating system and target of choice. 

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ort
   cd ort
   wget https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.17.0/onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu-1.17.0.tgz
   tar xvzf onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu-1.17.0.tgz 
   mv onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu-1.17.0/include .
   mv onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu-1.17.0/lib .
   ```

3. Build onnxruntime-genai

   ```bash
   cd ..
   python build.py --cuda_home <path_to_cuda_home> --cudnn_home <path_to_cudnn_home>
   ```
   
4. Install Python wheel

   ```bash
   cd build/wheel
   pip install *.whl
   ```

## Model download and export

ONNX models are run from a local folder, via a string supplied to the `Model()` method. 

To source `microsoft/phi-2` optimized for your target, download and run the following script. You will need to be logged into HuggingFace via the CLI to run the script.


```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/main/src/python/models/export.py
```

Export int4 CPU version 
```bash
huggingface-cli login --token <your HuggingFace token>
python export.py python models/export.py -m microsoft/phi-2 -p int4 -e cpu -o phi2-int4-cpu.onnx
```
