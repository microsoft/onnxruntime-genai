#Name;Url;SHA1
#This is a CSV file.
#The columns are separated by ";" because a list in cmake is just a ";" separated group of strings.
#Names should be in lower case. They will be used as variable names in cmake.
#URLs can be either https URLs or local file paths in cmake-style(directory separator is a forward slash character).
#SHA1 hashes can be generated by running sha1sum command on linux. PowerShell can also be used:
# (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1 <filename>).Hash.ToLower()
#If you need to change abseil's version to a different one, you may also want to update external\abseil-cpp.natvis
#since the file contains a version string: "lts_20230802". However, the file is for debugging purposes only and would
#not affect built binaries.
#
# NOTE: You must run deps_update_and_upload.py and generate_cgmanifest.py when ready to test your changes in a CI.
